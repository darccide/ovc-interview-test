# OVC Interview Test

This application was written for the OneViewCommerce Interview Test. The test asked for the applicant to write a React Typescript redux app to display a table using the api endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): Javascript front-end library for UI (user
  interface) component rendering
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/): Testing Framework for Javascript Testing.
- [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk): Thunk Middleware for Redux.

## Issues I encountered
I had virtually no issue getting up to speed with Typescript (this is my first attempt at writing a Typescript app) and I had very little problem encorporatating redux into this Typescript React project. However, I had issues with testing and hope to improve the tests and test coverage. I could find almost no useful documentation for testing React-Redux Typescript apps. I have spent hours upon hours over the course of the week trying to correct the issues I have had with testing. I have included samples of these efforts. I would love anyone reading this to share some information as to how I can test React-Redux Typescript applications.
